Introducing Send.it 🚀

The fairest token launchpad on Solana.

No insiders. No presales. No BS.

Just pure, fair launches for everyone.

🧵 Thread below ↓

The problem with token launches today:

❌ Insiders front-run
❌ Devs dump on you
❌ Snipers eat the first candle
❌ You're exit liquidity

We built Send.it to fix ALL of this. Here's how ↓
```

### Tweet 3
```
🟢 Bonding Curve Launches

Every token on Send.it launches on a fair bonding curve.

Price starts at zero. Everyone buys in at the same curve. No hidden allocations.

Math doesn't lie. Code doesn't cheat.
```

### Tweet 4

🛡️ Anti-Snipe Protection

Bots ruining launches? Not here.

Send.it has built-in anti-snipe mechanics so real humans get a fair shot.

Your degen reflexes > their MEV bots.
```

### Tweet 5
```
💧 Automatic Raydium Migration

Hit the bonding curve target → liquidity auto-migrates to Raydium.

No manual LP. No dev keys. No rug window.

It just... works. Trustlessly.
```

### Tweet 6
```
🔒 No Dev Allocation. Period.

Zero tokens reserved for team.
Zero presale.
Zero private rounds.

The dev buys on the same curve as you. That's how it should be.
```

### Tweet 7
```
⚡ Built on Solana

Sub-second finality. Fraction-of-a-cent fees.

Launch a token for less than the cost of a coffee.

This is what crypto was supposed to feel like.
```

### Tweet 8
```
Why Send.it over the rest?

✅ Fairer curves
✅ Anti-snipe built in
✅ Auto Raydium migration
✅ No insider advantage
✅ Solana-native speed

We're not competing. We're replacing.

## Day 11: Educational Thread
```
How bonding curves actually work (simple version):

Imagine a vending machine 🎰

First token = $0.0001
1000th token = $0.001
10000th token = $0.01

The more people buy, the higher the price goes.

The curve is the market maker. No humans needed.

This is Send.it. #Solana #SendIt

Why "fair launch" matters:

In traditional launches, insiders get 20-40% of supply before you even see a tweet.

On Send.it, the first buyer and the last buyer follow the SAME curve.

That's not a feature. That's a principle.

The launchpad starter pack:

❌ Other platforms: Presale → insider dump → you hold the bag

Choose wisely.
